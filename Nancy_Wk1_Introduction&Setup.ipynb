    "1. **What is Git?**  \n",
    "\n",
    "   B. A distributed version control system    \n",
    " \n",
    "2. **Which Git command initializes a new repository in your project folder?**  \n",
    "    \n",
    "   C. `git init`  \n",
    "   \n",
    "3. **How do you check the status of your working directory and staging area?**  \n",
    "      \n",
    "   C. `git status`  \n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Which command adds your changes to the staging area in Git?**  \n",
    "  \n",
    "   C. `git add`  \n",
    "\n",
    "5. **How do you create a new branch and switch to it immediately?**  \n",
    "\n",
    "   D. Both B and (with Git 2.23+) `git switch -c [branch-name]`\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **What does the `git merge` command do?**  \n",
    "    \n",
    "   B. It combines changes from one branch into the branch you’re currently on.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Explain the difference between `git fetch` and `git pull`.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The major difference between the two lies in the fact that `git fetch` does download the changes made in the remote repository and does not automatically intergrate them in the headbranch in the local working repository while `git pill` is used to get changes/commits made from another branch and automatically make changes or merge them in the head branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **If you accidentally commit sensitive information and have already pushed it to a remote repository, what is a recommended method to remove it safely?**\n",
    "\n",
    "I would use the command `git checkout <commit-hash> to remove that sensitive information from the commit history.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **What is a \"detached HEAD\" state in Git, and how can you resolve it?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A detached haed state is when a header is pointing at a commit rather than the head branch as it should which mainly occurs when a commit is removed.This situation can be salvaged by switching back to the head branch that you are working with through `git checkout<branch-name> to make sure that the header is at that point at a certain head branch\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Compare and contrast Git merging and rebasing. What are the advantages and potential pitfalls of using `git rebase` in a collaborative workflow?**\n",
    "\n",
    "In Git merging and rebasing basically do the same work i.e. intergrating changes/ commits from other branches to another branch. They all work by switching into the branch in which the changes are to be directed and making it the current head branch. The difference comes in on the output of the two processes.\n",
    "1. For mmerge there is a merge commit that is created which clearly shows all the hstory and gives clear picture of the two brnaches beingmerged \n",
    "2. For the rebase there is no branching out, no new commits are created, no history to be shown and it looks like the development has been done in a straight \n",
    "line.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of rebase\n",
    "a) There are less commits created since history is in a straight line(linear) in the process of development hence its easier to read through the history.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages\n",
    "a) It is difficult to trace how the development process occured and at what points and from where the changes were made in the code leading to loss of previous work.\n",
    "b) Can be a cause of confusion in a case where multiple developers are working on a certain project.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. **(Optional) Create a fork of this repo and submit the assignment by committing your changes to that fork.** \n",
